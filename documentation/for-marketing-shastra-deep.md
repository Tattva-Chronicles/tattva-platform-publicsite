# 📘 Shastra Deep — Launch Messaging Document

**Purpose:** Public launch announcements across Reddit, YouTube, X (Twitter), LinkedIn, WhatsApp, and similar platforms
**Positioning:** Research-oriented, reference-first, non-devotional, non-sensational

---

## 1. Core Positioning (Do Not Deviate)

Before posting anywhere, keep these points fixed:

### What Shastra Deep **IS**

* A **structured digital knowledge library** for Sanātana Dharma
* Focused on **texts, concepts, traditions, and terminology**
* **Accuracy, sourcing, and structure** over simplification
* AI is used **as a tool**, with **human editorial oversight**
* Designed for **study, reference, and exploration**

### What Shastra Deep **IS NOT**

* Not a devotional platform
* Not a shortcut to spiritual practice
* Not verse-centric or Gita-centric
* Not influencer-driven or opinion-led
* Not social-media-style summaries

This clarity prevents backlash and builds trust.

## 2. Reddit — Launch Titles

Reddit titles must sound **personal, reflective, and non-promotional**.

### General / Dharma-focused Subreddits

(r/hinduism, r/India, r/IndianCulture, r/philosophy)

* **“I built a structured digital library for Sanātana Dharma — feedback welcome”**
* **“An attempt to document Sanātana Dharma texts without simplification”**
* **“Why I felt the need to build a serious knowledge library for Sanātana Dharma”**
* **“Working on a reference-first digital archive for Sanātana Dharma”**
* **“Looking for feedback on a research-oriented Sanātana Dharma platform”**

---

### Builder / Startup Subreddits

(r/startups, r/SideProject, r/BuildInPublic)

* **“Building a reference-first knowledge platform for Sanātana Dharma”**
* **“Side project: structuring classical Indian knowledge without social-media dilution”**
* **“I’m building a research-oriented digital library for Sanātana Dharma”**
* **“Launching a niche knowledge platform focused on accuracy over virality”**

---

### Titles to Strictly Avoid on Reddit

Do **not** use:

* “Launching Shastra Deep 🚀”
* “World’s first…”
* “AI-powered Hinduism platform”
* “Best site for Hindu scriptures”

These trigger downvotes or moderation.

## 3. Reddit — Main Post Content

### Recommended Reddit Launch Post

```
Namaste 🙏

I’ve been quietly working on a project called Shastra Deep, and it’s now live.

It’s a research-oriented digital library for Sanātana Dharma — built to preserve and organize classical Indian knowledge systems in a structured, reliable way, without simplification, sensationalism, or personal ideology.

Most online Dharma content today is fragmented or mixed with opinion. Shastra Deep attempts to address that by:
• documenting traditional texts and concepts faithfully,
• explaining how material is structured traditionally,
• building a deep Sanskrit glossary with context and etymology,
• using AI only as a tool, with careful human editorial review.

This is not a devotional platform or a substitute for lived tradition. It’s meant for study, reference, and exploration.

It’s still early, and I’m sharing this mainly to get thoughtful feedback.

Constructive criticism is welcome.

## 4. YouTube — Video Titles

YouTube allows narrative, but **never sensationalism**.

### Authority-Building Titles

* **“Why I Built Shastra Deep: Preserving Sanātana Dharma Without Dilution”**
* **“Shastra Deep: A Research-Oriented Digital Library for Sanātana Dharma”**
* **“Documenting Sanātana Dharma in the Digital Age — A Builder’s Perspective”**
* **“Can Classical Indian Knowledge Be Preserved Online Properly?”**

---

### Slightly More Reach-Optimized (Still Respectful)

* **“Most Online Dharma Content Is Fragmented — Here’s What I Tried Instead”**
* **“Why I Didn’t Want Another ‘Explainer’ Site for Sanātana Dharma”**
* **“Rebuilding How Sanātana Dharma Knowledge Is Documented Online”**

The goal is to document texts, concepts, and traditions faithfully — with structure, context, and reliable sourcing — without reducing them to soundbites or opinions.

AI is used as a supporting tool, with human editorial oversight, and the platform is meant for study and reference rather than devotional instruction.
